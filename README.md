# Polyline

This repo is a Go implementation of the Google Maps Polyline encoding algorithm. It has been something I've wanted to do for a while, and I'm excited to finally have the chance to build it.

For more information, visit Google's explanation of the algorithm [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm).

### Next steps:
- Polyline decoding
